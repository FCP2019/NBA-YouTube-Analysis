The goal of this project is to examine each NBA team's YouTube channel to understand what content works and what content does not. Ultimately, we want to know:

A. What teams are performing well in terms of viewership/engagement (relative to the size of their subscriber base)?
B. What day of the week is best for NBA teams to post on YouTube?
C. How long should NBA teams make their videos to maximize viewership and engagement?
D. Does volume of posts affect viewership or engagement across team channels?
